ðŸ§  MCP-With-AI-Agents
MCP-With-AI-Agents is a basic multi-agent system where intelligent agents collaborate to solve a Multi-Constraint Problem (MCP). The system demonstrates how AI agents can interact, share information, and make decisions to satisfy multiple constraints in a distributed or centralized environment.

ðŸš€ Key Features:
Multiple autonomous agents with simple decision logic.

Constraint handling (e.g., task allocation, resource limits, time).

Communication between agents (optional).

Scalable and easy to extend.
